Resolve or Translate SID to Username in Powershell
This will require administrative rights in most cases, to run the script you need to make sure you have ExecutionPolicy set from disable to your choice. To set your execution policy easily, all you gotta do is the Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Policyouwant -Force
When entering your SID, you do not need to have the Domain information or machine information added, i.e. Computername\Username or Domain\Username. Since this is utilizing NTAccount. 

This is useful for just simple verification, or, when doing forensics on a machine/box to find out what user was doing a "thing".

I threw up a new website, if you like this script, like any of my blog stuff, please share. 
I'm in the market for a new home, a new challenge, a new place to automate.
So you can help a brother out by sharing some of this content, the sites content, or just the site itself. 
I would super preeeesh, and it would help me out a lot. 
Or if you want me to look at any of your work, or help troubleshoot, let me know! ::I'll remove any mention of ya, unless you are cool with me blogging about it. If that's ok, I'll let you review before I post it. Just let me know how to mention or "call back" at ya.::
